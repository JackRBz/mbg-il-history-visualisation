All info is taken from the MBG ILs WR History spreadsheet
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dj1HEUXkyALK8qCAuzAEetnvJhvJjWBxd1Nr5GR5CYc/edit#gid=0

Some info within spreadsheet is incomplete, and so has to be edited for processing purposes:
-Any Screenshot Glitch times are removed
-Any times without 3rd decimal are assumed to have 3rd dec of 9, just like WR times
-Any unknown dates e.g. 2009-01-XX are replaced with 01 e.g. 2009-01-01
--Only potential exceptions are if it breaks chronological order

Each level is represented by a single csv, numerating them by their level number
-For example:
--1.csv = Learning to Roll, 25.csv = Jump jump jump
